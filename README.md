# Unity Procedural City

A procedural city generation setup in Unity, in the style of Paris from Assassin's Creed: Unity.

## Features
- Super cool road generator, from which the rest of the city is generated
- Most intensive generation steps things happen on a separate thread, so ensure Unity doesn't freeze up during generation
- Simple depth fog effect
- Krita texture importer, so .kra files can be directly used as textures, just like any normal image file
